# Real_time-data_Sales_prediction
Developing a real-time data analytics dashboard using Streamlit and a pre-trained machine learning model. The dashboard should simulate real-time data, make predictions using a trained regression  and interactively display the data and predictions.

## Features

- **Simulated Sales Data**: Randomly generated sales data for various grocery products.
- **Regression Model**: A linear regression model that predicts total sales based on the number of units sold and the price per unit.
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Continuously updates with new sales data and predictions, displayed using Streamlit.
- **Visualization**: Graphs showing predicted sales trends over time.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need Python and the following dependencies:

- `streamlit`: For building the interactive dashboard.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing data.
- `joblib`: For saving and loading the trained machine learning model.
- `scikit-learn`: For training the regression model.
